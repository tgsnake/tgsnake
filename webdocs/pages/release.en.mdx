## Rengasdengklok
</center>

The Rengasdengklok Incident (Indonesian: Peristiwa Rengasdengklok) was the kidnapping of Sukarno and Hatta done by several pemuda, including Sukarni, Wikana, Aidit and Chairul Saleh. This incident occurred on August 16, 1945 in the early hours of the morning, around 04.00 WIB. Sukarno and Hatta were taken to Rengasdengklok, Karawang, to then be urged to accelerate the proclamation of the independence of the Republic of Indonesia, until an agreement was reached between the elderly groups represented by Sukarno, Hatta and Achmad Soebardjo with the pemuda group about when the proclamation will be carried out, especially after Japan suffered defeat in the Pacific War.
