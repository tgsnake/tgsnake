title : getAdminedPublicChannels 
--- 
## Overview 
Get channels/supergroups/geogroups we're admin in. Usually called when the user exceeds the limit for owned public channels/supergroups/geogroups, and the user is given the choice to remove one of his channels/supergroups/geogroups.
## Parameters 
```ts 
ctx.telegram.getAdminedPublicChannels(byLocation,checkLimit)
```
- `byLocation` (_boolean_) 
    - Get geogroups.
- `checkLimit` (_boolean_)
    - If set and the user has reached the limit of owned public channels/supergroups/geogroups, instead of returning the channel list one of the specified errors will be returned.  
    - Useful to check if a new public channel can indeed be created, even before asking the user to enter a channel username to use in channels.checkUsername/channels.updateUsername.  
## Example 
```ts highlight=3
bot.command("getAdminedPublicChannels",async (ctx) => {
    if(!ctx.chat.private){
        let results = await ctx.telegram.getAdminedPublicChannels()
        console.log(results)
    }
})
```
