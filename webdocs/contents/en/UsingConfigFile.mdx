## Overview 
This is a config file for tgsnake. You can pass all option in there to make your index file is clean. 
## Option 
We have a many option then if you use them together it will make your index file long. The options are: 
```ts 
interface option {
  /**

   * defaults to 5.
   */
  requestRetries?: number;
  /**
   * How many times the reconnection should retry, either on the initial connection or when Telegram disconnects us.<br/>
   * May be set to a negative or undefined value for infinite retries, but this is not recommended, since the program can get stuck in an infinite loop.<br/>

   */

  autoReconnect?: boolean;
  /** does nothing for now */
  sequentialUpdates?: boolean;
  /** The threshold below which the library should automatically sleep on flood wait and slow mode wait errors (inclusive).<br/>
   *  For instance, if a FloodWaitError for 17s occurs and floodSleepThreshold is 20s, the library will sleep automatically.<br/>
   *  If the error was for 21s, it would raise FloodWaitError instead. defaults to 60 sec.*/
  floodSleepThreshold?: number;
  /**
   * Device model to be sent when creating the initial connection. Defaults to os.type().toString().
   */
  deviceModel?: string;
  /**
   * System version to be sent when creating the initial connection. defaults to os.release().toString() -.
   */

   */
  baseLogger?: string | any;
  /**
   * Whether to try to connect over Wss (or 443 port) or not.
   */
  useWSS?: boolean;
}
```

## Example Using 
First you must to create a `tgsnake.config.js` in root directory (where package.json is available).   
Then copy this code 
```ts:tgsnake.config.js
module.exports = {
    apiHash : "your api hash" 
    // fill with available options in here.
}
```

Then the index file should be : 
```ts:index.ts {2} showLineNumber
import {Snake} from "snake" 
const bot = new Snake() // don't pass the option in here because you already pass in config file.
// ..your code.. 
bot.run()
```
Done.
